##### Notes
* Way to set the interval of subscriptions? Or a 1-time ping? Way to trigger it once, whenever you want?
Config toggle connection on/off
* Way to command to connect (not just disconnect) w/ optional ID
* Localizations/resources correct?

* Split hero logic into helper library to keep MC-only and hero-only stuff separate? (Could do pseudo-library for now, as one big package).
* Unit testing for logic not bound to minecraft (pure java messaging)
