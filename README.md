### Description

This mod uses [Hero.tv](https://www.hero.tv/) to allow viewers to react to a stream with emoticons.

This closes the gap between the streamer and the viewer, making it more interactive and thereby more enjoyable for everyone.

Hero Reactions is a mod that simply integrates this functionality into Minecraft. This occurs with the addition of an overlay in the bottom corner of the screen, and when reactions occur the streamer will see them pop up in-game!
