# Hero Reactions

### Description

Think Facebook live reactions, in Minecraft, via your streaming service of choice (e.g. Twitch). There are 5 reactions users can click at any time: shock, laughter, applause, love, and anger. Instead of trying to do the impossible (playing the game while constantly scanning Twitch chat to understand the sentiment of your crowd), streamers can now simply glance at the bottom of your screen and get an impression for how many people are watching, how people generally feel, and how people feel at specific moments. This has profound effects, ranging from greatly increasing retention to data analytics that show what actions lead up to moments that make viewers feel engaged. It allows for more transparent revenue cuts via Hero, making everyone feel better about donations/purchases. Essentially, by creating engagement to the audience (at any scale), you can have more information about what works and what doesnâ€™t, allowing for the creation of the best possible streams (benefiting everyone involved)!

Because of the above, I am making a mod to integrate these live reactions into Minecraft.
